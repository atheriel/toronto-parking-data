The [data dictionary](http://opendata.toronto.ca/revenue/parking/ticket/parking_tickets_readme.xls) for the raw parking tickets data sets points to a complex encoding of the location the ticket was given at. It looks as though there can be two street addresses, along with a description of the "proximity" of each. What does this mean in practice? And is it possible to map this location encoding to, say, longitude and latitude?

To get a sense of what is going on, we can load the data in the staging table

``` r
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

db <- src_sqlite("../tickets.sqlite")
tickets_staging <- tbl(db, "tickets_staging")
```

And take a peek at the location rows:

``` r
tickets_staging %>%
    select(location1:location4) %>%
    print(n = 20)
```

    ## Source:   query [?? x 4]
    ## Database: sqlite 3.11.1 [../tickets.sqlite]

    ## # ... with more rows

From this particular sample, this data doesn't look so bad. The answer to why there are sometimes one and sometimes two street addresses seems to be that some entries point to an intersection.

How complete is the location data? And how often is an intersection -- as opposed to a single address -- assigned to a ticket?

``` r
location.counts <- tickets_staging %>%
    summarise(total = n(),
              one = sum(!is.na(location2)),
              two = sum(!is.na(location4))) %>%
    collect()

location.counts %>%
    mutate(one = one / total, two = two / total)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 Ã— 3
    ##      total       one        two
    ##      <int>     <dbl>      <dbl>
    ## 1 20723102 0.9996146 0.04723776

So these intersections are less common than one might have thought, looking at the sample above. The overwhelmingly more common case is that of a single address. It's also clear that the location data is pretty complete. More than 99 percent of tickets have non-missing data.
